The files logic.mli, logic.ml, proof.mli, proof.ml define the library,
which is easy to compile with the command

$ make

To make the modules defined by this library visible in the interpreter,
the logic.cma file should be passed as a parameter to the interpreter:

$ utop logic.cma

If you have trouble compiling a library, you can always compile it
manually, although it is not the most convenient method:

$ ocamlc -c logic.mli
$ ocamlc -c logic.ml
$ ocamlc -c proof.mli
$ ocamlc -c proof.ml
$ ocamlc -a -o logic.cma logic.cmo proof.cmo

Remember that the library must be recompiled after each change.
